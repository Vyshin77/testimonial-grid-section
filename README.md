## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge is to build out this blog preview card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.
Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Live Site URL: []

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive mobile display
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

The major learning point for me when undertaking this project was the use of CSS Grid. I was able to implement my knowledge in CSS grid in designing the display of this challenge. This helped me to be able to position the various testimonies

Here are some code snippets below;
```css
.container {
  width: 80%;
  font-size: 13px;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  display: grid;
  gap: 1.5rem;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
  position: absolute;
}
```

### Continued development

I will like to use CSS grid in subsequent projects
